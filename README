= Arrow Shooter =

A fantastic game by Julien Sagot, aka sagotch.

== Movement ==

Use W to go left, D to go right.
W allows you to jump. Consider doing wall jumps.

== Shoot ==

Use mouse to aim your target.
Push left button to start loading you shot.
Release it to fire. The more you stay pressing the left button,
the more your arrow will be fired powerfully.

== The enemy ==

The enemy is a ghost shooting magical fire balls.
You will quickly notice that nor the ghost, nor the fire balls care
about walls or gravity.

The ghost may move in the right hand side half of the scene.

== Powerup ==

Every 20 seconds, a health pack will fall from the sky.
Note that it will always appears in the ghost area of action,
so you will need to be brave to regain health.
